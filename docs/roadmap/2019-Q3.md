# Kruise 2019 Q3 Roadmap

By the end of October, we plan to enhance the existing workload controllers with new features based 
on our original development plan and the feedbacks from the users. We also plan to release a few new 
workload controllers!

## Terminology

**M#** represents the milestone starting from **M1**. Each milestone corresponds to a three-four 
weeks release cycle. **M1** is expected to be released by the end of July 2019.

## Enhancements

### SidecarSet

* **[M1] Rolling Upgrade**: Support rolling upgrading the sidecar containers for matched Pods if
  the sidecar container image is the only updated component, i.e., the upgrade can be done via
  "InPlaceUpgrade" strategy.  In other cases where Pod recreation is needed, SidecarSet 
  will not proactively delete the affecting Pods. Instead, it "lazily" relies on **user** to trigger
  Pod workload upgrade to recreate the Pods. The new version of sidecar containers will be injected
  during Pod creation. The rolling upgrade is done in a sequential manner, which means
  `MaxUnavailable` is equal to one.


* **[M1] Paused Rollout**: User can pause the current rollout process to avoid potential conflicts with
  other controllers by setting the `Paused` flag. The rollout can be resumed by setting `Paused` to false.


* **[M2] Selective Upgrade**: An upgrade Pod selector is added. The new sidecar container version will
  only be applied to the Pods that match the upgrade selector. 


* **[M2] Parallel Upgrade**: Support `MaxUnavailable` feature, which allows upgrading sidecar containers
  for multiple Pods simultaneously.

### Advanced StatefulSet

* **[M1] Paused Rollout**: If the StatefulSet rollout takes a long time due to large number of replicas,
  a `Paused` flag is introduced to allow user to pause the current rollout process. 
  The rollout can be resumed by setting the `Paused` flag to false.


* **[M2] Auto Remediation**: When creating new Pods in scaling or rollout workflow, it is possible that
  a created Pod cannot reach `Ready` state due to certain node problems. For example, node
  misconfiguration may cause constant failures on pulling images or starting the containers. 
  `AutoRemediation` flag enables controller to delete a stuck pending Pod, and 
  create an [SchedPatch](#SchedPatch) CRD which injects a Pod-to-node anti-affinity rule for
  all new Pods created by this controller.


* **[M2] Condition Report**: Leverage the `StatefulSetConditionType` API to report the StatefulSet 
  condition based on the scaling or roll out results.

## New Controller

### SchedPatch

* **[M2]** This controller implements a Pod creation mutating webhook that adds auxiliary
  scheduling rules for Pods created by a target workload. The purpose is to change the
  Pod specification without modifying the target workload's Pod template, hence avoiding rolling
  out all existing Pods, in order to accommodate the new scheduling requirements. 
  The auxiliary scheduling rules specified in the CRD include affinity, tolerations and node 
  selectors. The CRD status reports the changed Pods for record.
