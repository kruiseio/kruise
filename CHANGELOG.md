# Change Log

## v0.8.0

### Breaking changes

1. The flags for kruise-manager must start with `--` instead of `-`. If you install Kruise with helm chart, ignore this.
2. SidecarSet has been refactored. Make sure there is no SidecarSet being upgrading when you upgrade Kruise,
   and read [the latest doc for SidecarSet](https://openkruise.io/en-us/docs/sidecarset.html).
3. A new component named `kruise-daemon` comes in. It is deployed in kruise-system using DaemonSet, defaults on every Node.

Now Kruise includes two components:

- **kruise-controller-manager**: contains multiple controllers and webhooks, deployed using Deployment.
- **kruise-daemon**: contains bypass features like image pre-download and container restart in the future, deployed using DaemonSet.

### New CRDs: NodeImage and ImagePullJob

[Official doc](https://openkruise.io/en-us/docs/imagepulljob.html)

Kruise will create a NodeImage for each Node, and its `spec` contains the images that should be downloaded on this Node.

Also, users can create an ImagePullJob CR to declare an image should be downloaded on which nodes.

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kruise.io/v1alpha1
kind: ImagePullJob
metadata:
  name: test-imagepulljob
spec:
  image: nginx:latest
  completionPolicy:
    type: Always
  parallelism: 10
  pullPolicy:
    backoffLimit: 3
    timeoutSeconds: 300
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      node-label: xxx
```

### SidecarSet

[Official doc](https://openkruise.io/en-us/docs/sidecarset.html)

- Refactor the controller and webhook for SidecarSet:
  - For `spec`:
    - Add `namespace`: indicates this SidecarSet will only inject for Pods in this namespace.
    - For `spec.containers`:
      - Add `podInjectPolicy`: indicates this sidecar container should be injected in the front or end of `containers` list.
      - Add `upgradeStrategy`: indicates the upgrade strategy of this sidecar container (currently it only supports `ColdUpgrade`)
      - Add `shareVolumePolicy`: indicates whether to share other containers' VolumeMounts in the Pod.
      - Add `transferEnv`: can transfer the names of env shared from other containers.
    - For `spec.updateStrategy`:
      - Add `type`: contains `NotUpdate` or `RollingUpdate`.
      - Add `selector`: indicates only update Pods that matched this selector.
      - Add `partition`: indicates the desired number of Pods in old revisions.
      - Add `scatterStrategy`: defines the scatter rules to make pods been scattered during updating.

### CloneSet

- Add `currentRevision` field in status.
- Optimize CloneSet scale sequence.
- Fix condition for pod lifecycle state from Updated to Normal.
- Change annotations `inplace-update-state` => `apps.kruise.io/inplace-update-state`, `inplace-update-grace` => `apps.kruise.io/inplace-update-grace`.
- Fix `maxSurge` calculation when partition > replicas.

### UnitedDeployment

- Support Deployment as template in UnitedDeployment.

### Advanced StatefulSet

- Support lifecycle hook for in-place update and pre-delete.

### BroadcastJob

- Add PodFitsResources predicates.
- Add `--assign-bcj-pods-by-scheduler` flag to control whether to use scheduler to assign BroadcastJob's Pods.

### Others

- Add feature-gate to replace the CUSTOM_RESOURCE_ENABLE env.
- Add GetScale/UpdateScale into clientsets for scalable resources.
- Support multi-platform build in Makefile.
- Set different user-agent for controllers.

## v0.7.0

### Breaking changes

Since v0.7.0:

1. OpenKruise requires Kubernetes 1.13+ because of CRD conversion.
  Note that for Kubernetes 1.13 and 1.14, users must enable `CustomResourceWebhookConversion` feature-gate in kube-apiserver before install or upgrade Kruise.
2. OpenKruise official image supports multi-arch, by default including linux/amd64, linux/arm64, and linux/arm platforms.

### A NEW workload controller - AdvancedCronJob
Thanks for @rishi-anand contributing!

An enhanced version of CronJob, it supports multiple kind in a template:

```yaml
apiVersion: apps.kruise.io/v1alpha1
kind: AdvancedCronJob
spec:
  template:

    # Option 1: use jobTemplate, which is equivalent to original CronJob
    jobTemplate:
      # ...

    # Option 2: use broadcastJobTemplate, which will create a BroadcastJob object when cron schedule triggers
    broadcastJobTemplate:
      # ...

    # Options 3(future): ...
```
