### Installation

- Simplify installation with helm charts, one simple command to install kruise charts, instead of downloading and executing scripts.

### Advanced StatefulSet

#### Features

- Support [priority update](./docs/concepts/astatefulset/README.md#priority-unordered-rolling-update-strategy), which allows users to configure the sequence for Pods updating.

#### Bugs

- Fix maxUnavailable calculation, which should not be less than 1.

### Broadcast Job

#### Bugs

- Fix BroadcastJob cleaning up after TTL.

---

## v0.3.0**

### Installation

- Provide a script to check if the K8s cluster has enabled MutatingAdmissionWebhook and ValidatingAdmissionWebhook admission plugins before installing Kruise.
- Users can now install specific controllers if they only need some of the Kruise CRD/controllers.

### Kruise-Controller-Manager

#### Bugs

- Fix a jsonpatch bug by updating the vendor code.

### Advanced StatefulSet

#### Features

- Add condition report in `status` to indicate the scaling or rollout results.

### A NEW workload controller - UnitedDeployment

#### Features

- Define a set of APIs for UnitedDeployment workload which manages multiple workloads spread over multiple domains in one cluster.
- Create one workload for each `Subset` in `Topology`.
- Manage Pod replica distribution across subset workloads.
- Rollout all subset workloads by specifying a new workload template.
- Manually manage the rollout of subset workloads by specifying the `Partition` of each workload.

### Documents

- Three blog posts are added in Kruise [website](http://openkruise.io/en-us/blog/index.html), titled:
    1. Kruise Controller Classification Guidance.
    2. Learning Concurrent Reconciling.
    3. UnitedDeploymemt - Supporting Multi-domain Workload Management.
- New documents are added for UnitedDeployment, including a [tutorial](./docs/tutorial/uniteddeployment.md).
- Revise main README.md.

---

## v0.2.0**

### Installation

- Provide a script to generate helm charts for Kruise. User can specify the release version.
- Automatically install kubebuilder if it does not exist in the machine.
